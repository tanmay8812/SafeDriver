Drowsiness detection
Developed a drowsiness detection system to alert drivers when they are feeling sleepy, helping to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness.
– Utilized OpenCV to detect faces and eyes using a Haar cascade classifier, achieving a detection accuracy rate of 92%.
– Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with Keras to predict the drowsiness status of the driver with an accuracy of 90%.
– Integrated a real-time alert mechanism to warn the driver within 2 seconds of detecting signs of drowsiness, improving response time by 30%.
– Conducted extensive testing with over 1,000 hours of driving footage to ensure the system's reliability and responsiveness.
– Technology Used: Python, OpenCV, Keras, Haar Cascade Classifier, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Version Control (Git).
